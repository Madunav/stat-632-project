The dataset contains information about the pricing model for 193 cars. we want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market .
We want to find out which variables are significant in predicting the price of the car.
We want to find out: 
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car in the American market.
2. How well these variables describe the price of the car.
We are going to consider a large data set of different types of cars across the American market.

Goal:
Firstly, we need to find the price of cars with the available independent variables.Secondly, Using these variables we will be able to understand how exactly the prices vary with respect to the independent variables. We can then accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the strategies and other variables meet certain price levels. This model wil serve as a good way to understand the pricing dynamics of the market.

We are going to use Multiple Linear Regression on the given Dataset.
Following are the different variables we will consider in the Dataset:
1.doornumber(The number of doors in the car).
2.carbody(Type of the car).
3.fueltype(The type of fuel the car uses).
4.carlength(The length of the car).
5.horsepower(The horsepower of the car in hp).
6.citympg(The mileage of a car in the city).
7.highwaympg(The mileage of a car on highways).
